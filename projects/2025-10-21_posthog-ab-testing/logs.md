## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Initial Brainstorming ✅
- [x] Created comprehensive brain dump
- [x] Identified all requirements and constraints
- [x] Defined 3 variants with detailed UI mockups
- [x] Specified metrics to track (comment rate, engagement, dwell time)
- [x] Addressed PostHog MCP setup requirements
- [x] Identified technical implementation approach

### Phase 2: Requirements Specification ✅
- [x] Created detailed specification document
- [x] Defined problem statement and stakeholders
- [x] Specified success metrics and validation criteria
- [x] Outlined scope boundaries and technical requirements
- [x] Defined user experience considerations
- [x] Created implementation plan and timeline

### Phase 2.5: Specification Review ✅
- [x] Growth Engineer review completed
- [x] Product Analyst review completed
- [x] Identified critical issues and recommendations
- [x] Updated specification for exploratory prototype approach
- [x] Simplified statistical requirements for prototype focus

### Phase 3: Project Structure Setup 🔄
- [x] Created project folder structure
- [x] Moved specification to proper location
- [x] Created project README
- [x] Created implementation plan
- [x] Created progress log
- [ ] Create individual tickets
- [ ] Set up tracking files

## 🚧 Current Work

**Active Task**: Creating project structure and tracking files
- Setting up proper folder organization
- Creating individual tickets for implementation
- Preparing for Phase 4: Design and Architecture Planning

## 📊 Key Decisions Made

1. **Exploratory Approach**: Decided to focus on infrastructure building rather than rigorous statistical analysis
2. **Multiple Primary Metrics**: Keeping multiple metrics for exploratory analysis
3. **Simplified Timeline**: Reduced from 4 weeks to 1 week for prototype
4. **Mock Data**: Using mock data initially, modular design for future real data
5. **Testing Toggle**: Adding manual variant switching for development/testing

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 3**: Finish project structure setup
2. **Create Tickets**: Break down implementation into specific tickets
3. **Phase 4**: Begin Design and Architecture Planning
4. **Phase 5**: Start implementation

## 🎯 Upcoming Milestones

- [ ] **Phase 3 Complete**: Project structure and tracking setup
- [ ] **Phase 4 Complete**: Design and architecture planning
- [ ] **Phase 5 Start**: Begin implementation
- [ ] **Foundation Setup**: PostHog SDK integration
- [ ] **Variant Implementation**: All 3 variants working
- [ ] **Analytics Setup**: Basic monitoring and dashboards

## 📈 Metrics Tracking

**Planning Metrics**:
- Brain dump completeness: 100%
- Specification completeness: 100%
- Review coverage: 100%
- Project structure: 80%

**Implementation Metrics** (to be tracked):
- Code coverage: TBD
- Test coverage: TBD
- Performance metrics: TBD
- User feedback: TBD

## 🚨 Issues and Risks

**Current Issues**: None

**Identified Risks**:
- PostHog integration complexity (Low risk - well documented)
- Event tracking accuracy (Medium risk - requires careful implementation)
- Performance impact (Low risk - minimal changes)
- User privacy concerns (Medium risk - mitigated by clear messaging)

## 📝 Notes and Observations

- User provided excellent detailed UI mockups for all 3 variants
- PostHog MCP integration is already enabled and working
- Existing codebase has good foundation for A/B testing
- Team is focused on infrastructure building rather than statistical rigor
- Timeline is aggressive but achievable for prototype scope
