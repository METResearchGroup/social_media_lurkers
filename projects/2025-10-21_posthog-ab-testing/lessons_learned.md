# Lessons Learned: PostHog A/B Testing Project

**Project**: PostHog A/B Testing for Post Detail Page Variants  
**Created**: October 21, 2025

## ðŸ“š Planning Phase Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Comprehensive Brain Dump**: Creating a detailed brain dump captured all requirements and constraints effectively
2. **Persona-Based Review**: Using Growth Engineer and Product Analyst personas provided valuable different perspectives
3. **Exploratory Approach**: Deciding to focus on infrastructure building rather than rigorous statistical analysis was the right call for a prototype
4. **Detailed UI Mockups**: User-provided mockups made requirements crystal clear
5. **Modular Design**: Planning for modular data system allows future real data integration

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Initial Over-Engineering**: Started with overly complex statistical requirements that weren't needed for prototype
2. **Timeline Estimation**: Initial 4-week timeline was too long for prototype scope
3. **Multiple Primary Metrics**: Initially tried to follow strict statistical rules that didn't fit exploratory nature

### Key Insights

1. **Prototype vs Production**: Different approaches needed for exploratory prototypes vs production experiments
2. **Infrastructure First**: Building reusable A/B testing infrastructure is more valuable than perfect statistical analysis
3. **User Input Quality**: Detailed user requirements (like UI mockups) significantly improve planning quality
4. **Persona Reviews**: Multiple persona reviews catch different types of issues and provide diverse perspectives

## ðŸ”§ Technical Lessons

### Architecture Decisions

1. **PostHog Cloud**: Choosing cloud over self-hosted was correct for prototype speed
2. **Mock Data**: Using mock data initially allows faster iteration and testing
3. **Feature Flags**: PostHog feature flags provide good foundation for A/B testing
4. **Modular Design**: Planning modular data system enables future real data integration

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Event Tracking**: Need to be careful about event accuracy and performance impact
2. **Variant Consistency**: Ensuring users get consistent variants across sessions is critical
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Manual testing toggle is essential for development and validation
4. **Performance**: Need to monitor performance impact of analytics and variant rendering

## ðŸ“Š Process Lessons

### Project Planning

1. **Phase-Based Approach**: Breaking into clear phases (Brainstorming â†’ Spec â†’ Review â†’ Setup â†’ Implementation) works well
2. **Tracking Files**: Creating comprehensive tracking files (README, plan, logs, tickets, todo) provides good project visibility
3. **Ticket Breakdown**: Breaking implementation into specific tickets with clear acceptance criteria helps with execution

### Communication

1. **Specification Review**: Getting user feedback on approach (exploratory vs rigorous) was crucial
2. **Persona Reviews**: Multiple perspectives catch different issues and provide better coverage
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation helps with handoffs and future reference

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Improvements

### For Next A/B Test

1. **Start with Exploratory**: Begin with exploratory approach, add rigor as needed
2. **Infrastructure Reuse**: Build on this foundation for future experiments
3. **Real Data Integration**: Plan for transitioning from mock to real data
4. **Statistical Rigor**: Add more statistical rigor for production experiments

### For Project Planning

1. **User Requirements**: Always get detailed user requirements upfront
2. **Persona Reviews**: Use multiple personas for comprehensive review
3. **Prototype Focus**: Distinguish between prototype and production requirements
4. **Modular Design**: Always plan for future extensibility
