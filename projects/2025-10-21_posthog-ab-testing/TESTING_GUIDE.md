### Event Tracking Verification

Use browser DevTools Console (F12) to check:
- [ ] Console shows "PostHog initialized" message
- [ ] Check Network tab for PostHog API calls to `us.i.posthog.com`
- [ ] Verify `post_viewed` event fires on page load
- [ ] Click Like button - verify `post_engagement` event
- [ ] Click Share button - verify `post_engagement` event
- [ ] Submit a comment - verify `post_engagement` event
- [ ] Scroll down the page - verify `post_scroll_depth` events
- [ ] Leave page or close tab - verify `post_dwell_time` event

### PostHog Dashboard Verification

1. Go to https://us.posthog.com/project/236915
2. Navigate to "Events" section
3. Check for these events:
   - `post_viewed`
   - `post_engagement`
   - `post_scroll_depth`
   - `post_dwell_time`
4. Verify event properties include:
   - `post_id`
   - `variant` (control/treatment/comparison)
   - `timestamp`
   - Additional properties per event type

### Feature Flag Verification

1. Go to PostHog Dashboard ‚Üí Feature Flags
2. Find "Post Detail Variant Test" (`post_detail_variant_test`)
3. Verify it shows 3 variants
4. Check rollout percentages (should be approximately 33% each)

### Responsive Design Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile width (< 768px)
- [ ] Test on tablet width (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] Test on desktop width (> 1024px)
- [ ] All panels resize appropriately
- [ ] Bar graphs remain readable
- [ ] Comparison panel switches to vertical on mobile

### Dark Mode Testing
- [ ] Toggle system dark mode
- [ ] All panels display correctly in dark mode
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Colors adjust appropriately
- [ ] Trust indicator tooltips work in dark mode

## üêõ Known Behaviors

### Expected Behaviors
- **Variant Toggle**: Only visible in development mode
- **Manual Override**: Persists across page refreshes (localStorage)
- **Mock Data**: Randomized per session but cached per post
- **Divergence**: Commenters vs viewers attitudes may show significant difference
- **Event Timing**: Dwell time sent on page exit, scroll depth sent every 5 seconds

### PostHog Feature Flag
- Feature flags may take a few seconds to load on first page visit
- Variant assignment is sticky once received
- Manual override takes precedence over feature flag

## üìä Testing with PostHog MCP

You can use the PostHog MCP in Cursor to verify events:

```javascript
// List recent events
mcp_posthog_search-events({
  naturalLanguageQuery: "post viewed events from last hour",
  limit: 10
})

// Check experiment data
mcp_posthog_experiment-get-all()
```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

All tickets should meet their individual acceptance criteria:
- ‚úÖ Ticket 001: PostHog SDK loads, no console errors
- ‚úÖ Ticket 002: Feature flag returns correct variant
- ‚úÖ Ticket 003: All events fire correctly
- ‚úÖ Ticket 004: Mock data displays, percentages sum to 100%
- ‚úÖ Ticket 005: Audience panel displays all sections
- ‚úÖ Ticket 006: Comparison panel shows divergence
- ‚úÖ Ticket 007: Toggle works, hidden in production

## üîß Troubleshooting

### PostHog Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY is set in .env
- Check Network tab for PostHog script loading
- Refresh page to retry initialization

### Events Not Appearing in PostHog
