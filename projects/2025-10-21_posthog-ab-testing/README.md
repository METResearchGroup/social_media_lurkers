# PostHog A/B Testing Project Overview

**Project**: PostHog A/B Testing for Post Detail Page Variants  
**Start Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Type**: Exploratory Prototype for A/B Testing Infrastructure

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build A/B testing infrastructure using PostHog to test 3 different variants of the post detail page (`/post/{hash_id}`) and measure user engagement to determine which variant performs best. This is an exploratory prototype focused on building reusable A/B testing infrastructure.

## 📋 Key Deliverables

- [ ] PostHog SDK integration in Next.js frontend
- [ ] 3 A/B test variants (Control, Treatment, Comparison)
- [ ] Feature flag management system
- [ ] Comprehensive event tracking
- [ ] Mock data system for audience statistics
- [ ] Testing toggle for manual variant switching
- [ ] Basic analytics dashboard
- [ ] Reusable A/B testing infrastructure

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-2)
- PostHog SDK integration
- Feature flag configuration
- Basic event tracking setup
- Mock data system implementation

### Phase 2: Variant Implementation (Days 3-5)
- Variant A (Control) - ensure current functionality
- Variant B (Treatment) - audience statistics panel
- Variant C (Comparison) - representation comparison
- Testing toggle component

### Phase 3: Analytics & Monitoring (Days 6-7)
- Basic event tracking
- Simple dashboard creation
- Basic monitoring setup
- Manual testing and validation

## 📊 Success Metrics (Exploratory)

**Primary Metrics**:
- Comment Rate: % of users who comment on posts
- Overall Engagement Rate: % of users who like, comment, or share
- Dwell Time: Average time spent on post detail pages

**Guardrail Metrics**:
- Page load time must not increase >200ms
- Error rate must not increase >0.5%
- User retention must not decrease
