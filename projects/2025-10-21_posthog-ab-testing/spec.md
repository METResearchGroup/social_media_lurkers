# Specification: PostHog A/B Testing for Post Detail Page Variants

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft  
**Project**: Social Media App A/B Testing Implementation

---

## 1. Problem Definition and Stakeholder Identification

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**Core Problem**: Social media platforms suffer from "commenter bias" - the visible comments on posts often don't represent the broader audience's views, leading to:
- Misleading representation of public opinion
- Reduced engagement from users who feel their views aren't represented
- Echo chamber effects where only vocal minorities participate
- Lower overall platform engagement and dwell time

**Specific Problem**: Our current post detail page (`/post/{hash_id}`) shows only comments without any context about the broader audience, potentially discouraging engagement from users who don't see their views represented in the visible comments.

### 1.2 Stakeholder Identification

**Primary Stakeholders**:
- **Product Team**: Decision-makers for feature rollout
- **Engineering Team**: Implementation and technical execution
- **Data/Analytics Team**: Metric definition and analysis
- **Users**: End consumers who will experience the variants

**Secondary Stakeholders**:
- **Design Team**: UI/UX implementation guidance
- **Legal/Privacy Team**: Compliance with data usage policies
- **Marketing Team**: Communication of new features

### 1.3 Success Criteria

**Business Success**: Increase user engagement and platform value through better representational accuracy.

**Technical Success**: Implement robust A/B testing infrastructure with PostHog that can be reused for future experiments.

**User Success**: Users feel more informed about the broader conversation and are more likely to engage when they see their views represented.

## 2. Success Metrics and Validation Criteria

### 2.1 Primary Success Metrics (Exploratory Analysis)

**Multiple Primary Metrics Approach** (exploratory prototype):

1. **Comment Rate**: Percentage of users who comment on posts after viewing
   - **Current Baseline**: [To be measured]
   - **Target Improvement**: 15% relative increase
   - **Measurement**: `(users_who_commented / users_who_viewed_post) * 100`

2. **Overall Engagement Rate**: Percentage of users who perform any engagement action (like, comment, share)
   - **Current Baseline**: [To be measured]
   - **Target Improvement**: 10% relative increase
   - **Measurement**: `(users_who_engaged / users_who_viewed_post) * 100`

3. **Dwell Time**: Average time spent on post detail pages
   - **Current Baseline**: [To be measured]
   - **Target Improvement**: 20% relative increase
   - **Measurement**: `average(page_exit_time - page_load_time)`

**Note**: This is exploratory analysis to build A/B testing infrastructure. Multiple metrics help us understand different aspects of user behavior and inform future experiments.

### 2.2 Guardrail Metrics (Must Not Break)

**Technical Guardrails**:
- Page load time must not increase >200ms (P95)
- Error rate must not increase >0.5%
- JavaScript bundle size increase <50KB

**Business Guardrails**:
- User retention (D7) must not decrease
- Overall platform engagement must not decrease
- User satisfaction scores must not decrease

**Privacy Guardrails**:
- No individual user data exposed
- Aggregate statistics only
- Clear privacy notices displayed

### 2.3 Secondary Metrics (Supporting Indicators)

**Engagement Quality**:
- Positive engagement rate (likes, shares, comments, profile clicks)
- Negative engagement rate (back button clicks, quick exits)
- Scroll depth (percentage of page scrolled)

**User Behavior**:
- Return visits to post detail pages
- Session duration after viewing posts
- Cross-post navigation patterns

**Representational Accuracy**:
- User perception surveys (if implemented)
- Trust indicator interaction rates
- Methodology tooltip engagement

## 4. User Experience Considerations

### 4.1 User Journey Mapping

**Current User Journey**:
1. User clicks on post from feed
2. Views post content
3. Scrolls through comments
4. Decides whether to engage (like, comment, share)
5. Exits page

**Enhanced User Journey (Variants B & C)**:
1. User clicks on post from feed
2. Views post content
3. **NEW**: Sees audience statistics panel
4. **NEW**: Reads trust indicators and methodology
5. Scrolls through comments with enhanced context
6. **NEW**: Better informed about broader audience views
7. Decides whether to engage with improved context
8. Exits page

### 4.2 User Experience Principles

**Transparency**: Users understand how statistics are calculated
**Privacy**: Individual user data is never exposed
**Neutrality**: Statistics are descriptive, not normative
**Accessibility**: All variants work for users with disabilities
**Performance**: No noticeable impact on page load or interaction

### 4.3 Trust and Credibility

**Trust Indicators**:
- Methodology tooltips explaining calculation methods
- Privacy guarantees ("Your individual views are never shown")
- Transparency about data sources ("Based on 247 viewers' profiles")
- Validation timestamps ("Updated every hour")

**Representational Accuracy Framing**:
- Neutral language: "Audience Statistics" (not "Lurker Stats")
- Descriptive tone: "Here's who's in the conversation"
- Avoid normative language: "You should post more!"
- Focus on information: "These show who's actually here"
