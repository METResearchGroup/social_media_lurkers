# Ticket 004: Mock Data System Implementation

**Ticket ID**: 004  
**Title**: Mock Data System Implementation  
**Phase**: 1 - Foundation Setup  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Pending

## 📋 Description

Create a modular mock data system for generating realistic audience statistics including political breakdown and attitude data for the A/B test variants.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Mock data generator creates realistic data
- [ ] Political breakdown data (Liberal/Moderate/Conservative)
- [ ] Attitude data (Support/Neutral/Oppose)
- [ ] Data is varied and realistic
- [ ] System is modular for future real data integration
- [ ] Data displays correctly in UI components

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- Create mock data generator function
- Generate political breakdown percentages
- Generate attitude percentages
- Ensure data adds up to 100%
- Create modular interface for future real data
- Add TypeScript types for data structure

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- Use consistent data across all users for testing
- Generate realistic percentages (not random)
- Create reusable data generation functions
- Design interface for future real data integration
- Add validation for data consistency
- Consider using Faker.js for additional realism

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Mock data is realistic and varied
- [ ] Data percentages add up to 100%
- [ ] Data displays correctly in UI
- [ ] System is modular and extensible
- [ ] No errors in data generation

## 🔗 Dependencies

- None (can be developed independently)

## 📊 Definition of Done

- Mock data system is implemented
- Data is realistic and consistent
- System is modular for future integration
- Data displays correctly in UI
- TypeScript types are defined
