## Planning Phase - 2025-10-16

### 2025-10-16 19:30 - Project Setup

**What I did**:
- Created braindump.md with initial requirements
- Generated comprehensive spec.md (v1.1)
- Conducted three-persona reviews (LLM Architect, Rapid Prototyper, Demo Expert)
- Synthesized review feedback
- Updated spec with improvements
- Created Linear project and ticket MET-61
- Set up project folder structure
- Created planning documents

**What worked**:
- Multi-persona review process caught important gaps (prompt versioning, demo prep, UI polish)
- Spec structure is comprehensive and clear
- Review scores average 88% - high confidence

**Key Decisions**:
- Store prompts in git-versioned files (not inline code)
- Pin dependency versions for reproducibility
- Add 6 demo test scenarios for validation
- Include demo preparation checklist and script
- Use GPT-4o-mini for cost-effectiveness

**Next steps**:
- Create GitHub PR with planning documents
- Begin implementation following plan_issue_discovery.md

**Time spent**: 2 hours (planning phase)
